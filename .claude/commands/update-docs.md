# Update Documentation

Synchronize documentation after feature implementation in worktree-utils:

1. **Update README.md**:
   - Add new features to the Features section
   - Update usage examples and command syntax
   - Ensure feature descriptions match current implementation
2. **Update CLI_ERGONOMICS.md**:
   - Mark completed features as resolved
   - Update current state analysis
   - Reflect new "Do What I Mean" capabilities
3. **Update CLI_ERGONOMICS_ROADMAP.md**:
   - Mark completed items as done
   - Update implementation status
   - Adjust future priorities based on completion
4. **Check Cross-references**: Ensure all documentation files reference each other correctly
5. **Verify Examples**: Test that all code examples and command syntax work as documented

Maintain consistency across all documentation and ensure it accurately reflects the current implementation state.
