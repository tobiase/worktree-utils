# Session Start Recovery

Perform comprehensive session context recovery for the worktree-utils project:

1. **Read Recent Context**: Check `docs/SESSION_LOG.md` for recent work, decisions, and next steps
2. **Git Status**: Run `git status` and `git log --oneline -5` to understand current state
3. **Pending Work**: Look for incomplete commits, staged changes, or pre-commit hook issues
4. **TODO Items**: Search for any TODO/FIXME comments or pending tasks
5. **Context Summary**: Provide a clear summary of:
   - What was recently accomplished
   - Current state of any in-progress work
   - Next priority tasks based on session history
   - Any issues that need immediate attention

This ensures seamless continuation of development work in the worktree-utils project.
