# Session End Documentation

Update the session documentation for the worktree-utils project:

1. **Update SESSION_LOG.md**: Add a new entry with today's date documenting:
   - What was accomplished in this session
   - Key decisions made and rationale
   - Technical implementation details
   - Any issues encountered and resolved
   - Next steps for future sessions

2. **Commit Documentation**: Create a commit for the session log updates using conventional commit format

3. **Session Summary**: Provide a brief summary of:
   - Major features/fixes completed
   - Files modified
   - Any follow-up work needed

Ensure the session log follows the established format and includes sufficient detail for future session continuity.
