# Zsh Completion Implementation Guide

## The Working Solution: Process Substitution

Based on research of kubectl, helm, terraform, and other successful CLI tools, **process substitution is the most reliable approach**:

```bash
# Add this line to ~/.zshrc:
source <(wt completion zsh)
```

This is what our setup command now does automatically.

## Why This Works

1. **No file management** - No files to create, maintain, or debug
2. **No fpath manipulation** - Works with any zsh configuration
3. **Always fresh** - Completion regenerated on each shell start
4. **Framework compatible** - Works with Oh-My-Zsh, Prezto, etc.
5. **Industry standard** - Same pattern as kubectl, helm, terraform

## Testing Commands

**Always test in fresh shells to avoid debugging artifacts:**

```bash
# Quick verification
make test-completion

# Interactive testing (for manual TAB testing)
make test-completion-interactive

# Debug completion script
make debug-completion

# Comprehensive test
./scripts/test-completion.sh
```

## Implementation Details

### What `wt completion zsh` Outputs

The completion command generates a self-contained script with:

```bash
#compdef wt
# Completion functions...
_wt() {
    # Completion logic
}
# Built-in compdef registration with error handling
if command -v compdef >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    compdef _wt wt
else
    autoload -Uz compinit && compinit
    compdef _wt wt
fi
```

### How Setup Works

1. **Shell function**: Adds `source <(wt-bin shell-init)` to shell config
2. **Completion**: Adds `source <(wt-bin completion zsh)` to shell config
3. **No files**: No init scripts or completion files needed

## Troubleshooting

### If completion doesn't work:

1. **Check the line exists**: `grep "wt-bin completion" ~/.zshrc`
2. **Test manually**: `source <(wt-bin completion zsh); type _wt`
3. **Clear cache**: `rm ~/.zcompdump* && exec zsh`
4. **Use testing tools**: `make test-completion`

### Common fixes:

- **Binary not in PATH**: Check `which wt-bin`
- **Cache corruption**: `rm ~/.zcompdump*`
- **Shell config issues**: Use `make test-fresh` for clean testing

## Research Sources

This approach is based on analysis of:
- [kubectl completion](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/#enable-shell-autocompletion)
- [helm completion](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_completion/)
- [terraform completion](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands)
- [GitHub CLI completion](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_completion)

All use process substitution as their primary recommendation.

## Development Testing

**Critical**: Use fresh shell testing to avoid false negatives from debugging artifacts:

```bash
make test-completion          # Quick test
make test-completion-interactive  # Manual TAB testing
```

Never test completion in the current development shell - it gets corrupted during debugging.
