## 2025-06-13 - Pre-commit Setup

### Context
After completing comprehensive tests for setup and update packages, set up pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality.

### Work Completed
1. **Pre-commit Configuration:**
   - Created `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with comprehensive checks
   - Configured hooks for:
     - Trailing whitespace removal
     - End-of-file fixing
     - YAML validation
     - Go formatting (gofmt)
     - Go vetting
     - Go mod tidy
     - Go build verification
     - Conventional commit messages
   - Worked around golangci-lint v1.55.2 compatibility issues with Go 1.24

2. **golangci-lint Configuration:**
   - Created `.golangci.yml` for future use
   - Configured linters: gofmt, govet, errcheck, gosimple, ineffassign, unused, misspell, goimports
   - Added exceptions for test files and update.go global variables
   - Added note about Go 1.24 compatibility issue

3. **Documentation Updates:**
   - Updated CONTRIBUTING.md with pre-commit setup instructions
   - Added Makefile targets: `setup-hooks` and `lint-all`

4. **Code Cleanup:**
   - Fixed trailing whitespace across entire codebase
   - Fixed missing newlines at end of files
   - All files now pass pre-commit checks

### Key Decisions
- Used pre-commit (Python-based) over lefthook (Go-based) for better ecosystem support
- Temporarily excluded golangci-lint from pre-commit due to Go 1.24 compatibility
- Enforced conventional commits with scope requirement
- Kept golangci-lint config for future use when compatibility improves

### Next Steps
1. Investigate Go version consistency across local, CI, and releases (user suggestion)
2. Consider using go.mod version or .go-version file for consistency
3. Create release v0.4.0 with test improvements
4. Continue with Phase 2: Shell completion implementation
5. Implement detailed help command

## 2025-06-13 - Setup and Update Package Tests

### Context
Continuing from locale handling fix, implemented comprehensive tests for setup and update packages as part of the testing infrastructure plan.

### Work Completed
1. **Setup Package Tests (88.2% coverage):**
   - Created `internal/setup/setup_test.go` with comprehensive test suite
   - Implemented test environment helpers for mocking file system operations
   - Tested all main functions: Setup(), Uninstall(), Check()
   - Tested helper functions: copyBinary(), detectShellConfigs(), addToShellConfig(), hasWtInit(), isInPath()
   - Edge cases covered:
     - Multiple shell configurations
     - Missing shell configs
     - Binary copy failures
     - PATH warnings
     - Existing installations

2. **Update Package Tests (89.6% coverage):**

## 2025-06-13 - Locale Handling Fix

### Context
User asked about LANG=C prefix requirement for tests and requested a permanent fix to avoid manual locale setting.

### Work Completed
1. **Fixed locale handling in tests:**
   - Created `test/integration/common_test.go` with shared test helpers
   - Added LANG=C environment setting to all command executions in tests
   - Updated all exec.Command calls to include consistent locale:
     - `buildTestBinary()` - Sets LANG=C for go build
     - `runCommand()` - Sets LANG=C for wt command execution
     - Git commands in test helpers - Sets LANG=C for git operations
   - Removed duplicate function definitions across test files

2. **Verified fix works:**
   - All tests now pass without requiring manual LANG=C prefix
   - Tests work consistently across different locale settings
   - No changes required to production code

### Key Decisions
- Set LANG=C only in test execution, not globally
- Maintained locale consistency across all test helpers
- Created common test file to reduce duplication
- Kept production code unchanged - only test infrastructure modified

### Next Steps
- Continue with remaining test implementation tasks
- Add tests for setup and update packages

## 2025-06-12 - Test Infrastructure and CLI Improvements

### Context
User noted unexpected command behavior and suggested creating a test harness before attempting CLI ergonomic improvements. After initial test implementation, continued with integration testing and ergonomic improvements.

### Work Completed
1. **Created comprehensive test infrastructure:**
   - Created test helper packages in `test/helpers/`:
     - `git.go` - Git repository creation and manipulation
     - `filesystem.go` - File system test utilities
     - `command.go` - Command execution mocking and recording

2. **Implemented unit tests for worktree package:**
   - Tests for `GetRepoRoot()`, `GetWorktreeBase()`
   - Tests for `parseWorktrees()`, `List()`, `Go()`
   - Tests for `NewWorktree()`, `CopyEnvFile()`
   - Handle macOS `/private` symlink paths
   - All tests passing (8 test functions, multiple sub-tests)

3. **Implemented unit tests for config package:**
   - Tests for `LoadProject()`, `matchesProject()`
   - Tests for `loadProjectConfig()`, `SaveProjectConfig()`
   - Tests for `GetCommand()`, `GetVirtualenvConfig()`
   - Tests for `registerVirtualenvCommands()`
   - All tests passing (10 test functions)

4. **Created integration tests:**
   - Shell wrapper tests (`test/integration/shell_test.go`)
   - Complete workflow tests (`test/integration/workflow_test.go`)
   - Command alias tests (`test/integration/aliases_test.go`)
   - Tests CD: and EXEC: prefix handling

5. **Added CLI entry point tests:**
   - Created `cmd/wt/main_test.go`
   - Tests for usage output, version formatting
   - Tests for shell wrapper output
   - Command line argument parsing tests

6. **Implemented command aliases:**
   - Added `ls` as alias for `list`
   - Added `switch` and `s` as aliases for `go`
   - Updated help text to show aliases
   - Added tests to verify aliases work correctly

7. **Set up GitHub Actions CI:**
   - Created `.github/workflows/test.yml` for testing
   - Multi-OS testing (Ubuntu, macOS)
   - Coverage reporting with Codecov
   - Linting with golangci-lint
   - Added test badge to README

### Key Decisions
- Started with unit tests before integration tests as recommended in testing plan
- Used table-driven tests throughout for clarity and maintainability
- Created comprehensive test helpers to reduce duplication
- Handled platform-specific issues (macOS symlinks) in tests
- Implemented aliases as a map for easy extension
- Chose simple, git-like aliases (ls, switch) for familiarity

### Next Steps
- [ ] Fix failing integration tests (env-copy, project commands)
- [ ] Add tests for setup and update packages

## 2025-06-05 - Worktree Base Configuration Fix

### Context
User reported that `wt` doesn't respect the `worktree_base` setting in project configurations.

### Work Completed
1. **Investigated the issue:**
   - Found that `worktree_base` is stored in project config but never used
   - Commands `wt add` and `wt new` always use the default convention
   - `GetWorktreeBase()` in internal/worktree/worktree.go:30 ignores project settings

2. **Implemented fix:**
   - Modified `worktree.Add()` to accept `*config.Manager` parameter
   - Modified `worktree.NewWorktree()` to accept `*config.Manager` parameter
   - Both functions now check for project-specific `worktree_base` setting
   - Updated calls in main.go to pass the config manager

3. **Created documentation:**
   - Created `docs/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md` - Documents architectural patterns
   - Created `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` - Development workflow guide
   - Created `docs/CLI_ERGONOMICS.md` - CLI usability assessment
   - Created this `SESSION_LOG.md` for session continuity

### Key Decisions
- Chose explicit parameter passing (Option A) over other patterns for config access
- Maintained backward compatibility - if no `worktree_base` is set, uses default convention
- Documented the pattern for future consistency

### Next Steps
- [ ] Test the worktree_base fix with actual project configs
- [ ] Consider implementing some of the "quick win" ergonomic improvements from CLI_ERGONOMICS.md
- [ ] Add shell completion support
- [ ] Create tests for the configuration system

### Open Questions
- Should we add a `wt config` command to view/edit project settings?
- Should project detection also consider .git/config for more flexibility?
