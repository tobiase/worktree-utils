## 2025-06-05 - Worktree Base Configuration Fix

### Context
User reported that `wt` doesn't respect the `worktree_base` setting in project configurations.

### Work Completed
1. **Investigated the issue:**
   - Found that `worktree_base` is stored in project config but never used
   - Commands `wt add` and `wt new` always use the default convention
   - `GetWorktreeBase()` in internal/worktree/worktree.go:30 ignores project settings

2. **Implemented fix:**
   - Modified `worktree.Add()` to accept `*config.Manager` parameter
   - Modified `worktree.NewWorktree()` to accept `*config.Manager` parameter
   - Both functions now check for project-specific `worktree_base` setting
   - Updated calls in main.go to pass the config manager

3. **Created documentation:**
   - Created `docs/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md` - Documents architectural patterns
   - Created `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` - Development workflow guide
   - Created `docs/CLI_ERGONOMICS.md` - CLI usability assessment
   - Created this `SESSION_LOG.md` for session continuity

### Key Decisions
- Chose explicit parameter passing (Option A) over other patterns for config access
- Maintained backward compatibility - if no `worktree_base` is set, uses default convention
- Documented the pattern for future consistency

### Next Steps
- [ ] Test the worktree_base fix with actual project configs
- [ ] Consider implementing some of the "quick win" ergonomic improvements from CLI_ERGONOMICS.md
- [ ] Add shell completion support
- [ ] Create tests for the configuration system

### Open Questions
- Should we add a `wt config` command to view/edit project settings?
- Should project detection also consider .git/config for more flexibility?
