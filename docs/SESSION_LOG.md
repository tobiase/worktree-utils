- Established semantic versioning decision trees for feature releases

### Key Decisions
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: All major patterns discovered during development should be captured
- **Session Continuity**: SESSION_LOG.md reading is now explicitly marked as essential first step
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Established backward compatibility as core principle for command evolution
- **Help System Standards**: Universal help integration is now documented architectural requirement

### Session Reflection: Claude Code & wt Command Analysis

#### Claude Code Custom Commands
Identified repetitive patterns that would benefit from custom commands:

**Release Management**: `/release-workflow`, `/version-bump`, `/ci-watch`
**Session Continuity**: `/session-start`, `/session-end`, `/context-recovery`
**Pre-commit Hooks**: `/fix-hooks`, `/commit-with-hooks`
**Documentation**: `/update-docs`, `/help-integration`

These would eliminate manual repetition and ensure consistency across development sessions.

#### wt Command Ideas
Reviewed potential additions based on current codebase:

**High-Value Candidates:**
- `wt status` - Cross-worktree status overview
- `wt clean` - Remove worktrees for merged branches
- `wt sync` - Pull latest across all worktrees

**Medium-Value Candidates:**
- `wt info [branch]` - Detailed worktree information
- `wt compare <branch1> <branch2>` - Cross-worktree comparison
- `wt config` - Interactive project configuration

**Implementation Priority**: Focus on `wt status` as next major feature (most commonly needed workflow command)

### Next Steps for Future Sessions
1. Consider implementing `wt status` command for comprehensive worktree overview
2. Evaluate adding cleanup commands (`wt clean`, `wt prune`) for maintenance workflows
3. Monitor user feedback on v0.9.0 environment management features
4. Consider adding more sophisticated project configuration management

### Documentation Impact
CLAUDE.md now serves as comprehensive development guide covering:
- Architectural patterns and when to use them
- Operational workflows for CI/release management
- Session continuity best practices
- Command evolution strategies
- Help system implementation requirements

This enhancement ensures future development sessions have clear guidance for maintaining code quality and consistency.

## 2025-06-16 - Universal Help System Implementation

### Context
After completing Issue #4 (Interactive Fuzzy Finding Support), implemented a comprehensive help system to address the CLI ergonomics gap where commands like `wt go --help` would try to switch to a "--help" branch instead of showing help.

### Work Completed

#### 1. **Help System Infrastructure**
- Created `internal/help/help.go` with comprehensive help system:
  - `CommandHelp` struct for structured help information
  - `ShowCommandHelp()` function with professional formatting (NAME, USAGE, OPTIONS, EXAMPLES, SEE ALSO)
  - `HasHelpFlag()` function for consistent help flag detection
  - Complete help content for all 10 commands with detailed descriptions, examples, and cross-references

#### 2. **Universal Help Integration**
- Updated `cmd/wt/main.go` to integrate help system into all commands:
  - Added help flag constants (`--help`, `-h`) to eliminate code duplication
  - Modified all command handlers to check for help flags first
  - Implemented proper flag filtering to remove help flags from argument parsing
  - Maintained backwards compatibility with existing command behavior

#### 3. **Test Compatibility Updates**
- Updated `cmd/wt/setup_completion_test.go` for new help behavior:
  - Changed test expectations from expecting `setup --help` to fail to expecting success
  - Updated validation to check help content format instead of error messages
  - Ensured test compatibility with new help system

### Technical Implementation Details

**Help System Architecture:**
- Central help content management in `internal/help/help.go`
- Consistent formatting with sections: NAME, USAGE, OPTIONS, EXAMPLES, SEE ALSO
- Support for command aliases in help content
- Flag descriptions with examples
- Cross-references between related commands

**Integration Pattern:**
```go
// Applied to all command handlers
if help.HasHelpFlag(args, "commandName") {
    return
}
```

**Help Content Features:**
- Detailed usage patterns for each command
- Comprehensive flag documentation with examples
- Real-world usage examples for each command
- "SEE ALSO" cross-references for related commands
- Support for command aliases (ls, switch, s)

### Verification
- ✅ All commands now support `--help` and `-h` flags
- ✅ Help content shows detailed, professional documentation
- ✅ `make test-ci` passes with updated test expectations
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks pass (formatting, linting, conventional commits)

### Key Decisions
- Used centralized help system rather than per-command help strings
- Implemented help flag detection before argument parsing to avoid conflicts
- Created comprehensive help content for all commands, not just core ones
- Maintained consistent formatting across all help output

### Next Steps for Future Sessions
1. Update CLI_ERGONOMICS_ROADMAP.md to reflect completed features
2. Consider enhancing environment management (`wt env` subcommands)
3. Add command discovery features (`wt commands`, `wt help <command>`)

### Commits Made
- `1b1a4d1` - feat: add comprehensive help system infrastructure
- `55c7d4e` - feat: integrate help system into all commands
- `fc9b786` - test: update setup completion test for help system integration

## 2025-06-14 Part 2 - Shell Completion Critical Fixes & Learnings

### Context
Continued from morning session. User reported two major issues:
1. `wt --help` shows minimal help instead of comprehensive usage
2. Shell completion completely broken with errors like "_arguments:comparguments:327: can only be called from completion function"

### Work Completed

#### 1. **Fixed `--help` Flag Support**
- Added support for `--help` and `-h` flags in main.go:48-58
- Now shows comprehensive help instead of error

#### 2. **Researched and Fixed Zsh Completion Structure**
**CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: Zsh completion requires specific file structure and loading patterns:

**✅ WORKING ZSH COMPLETION PATTERN:**
```bash
# 1. File location: ~/.config/wt/completions/_wt (underscore prefix required)
# 2. File content: starts with #compdef wt
# 3. Loading sequence:
fpath=(~/.config/wt/completions $fpath)
autoload -Uz compinit && compinit
autoload -Uz _wt
# 4. Test: type _wt (should show "autoload shell function")
```

**❌ BROKEN PATTERNS THAT DON'T WORK:**
- Direct sourcing: `source ~/.config/wt/completion.zsh`
- Wrong file name: `completion.zsh` instead of `_wt`
- Calling `compdef` manually (causes subscription range errors)
- Having `_wt "$@"` at end of completion file

#### 3. **Setup Command Enhancements**
- Added `validateAndRepairInstallation()` function to detect and fix:
  - Empty/corrupted binary files (major issue found)
  - Missing completion files
  - Wrong file permissions
  - Problematic shell configurations
- Made completion generation shell-specific (only bash/zsh when requested)
- Fixed tests to match new behavior

#### 4. **Shell Integration Improvements**
- Updated init script to use proper zsh completion loading
- Moved from `~/.config/wt/completion.zsh` to `~/.config/wt/completions/_wt`
- Removed problematic `compdef` calls that caused errors

### Key Technical Discoveries

#### **Working Zsh Completion Init Script Pattern:**
```bash
elif [[ -n "$ZSH_VERSION" ]]; then
  # Add wt completion directory to fpath
  fpath=(~/.config/wt/completions $fpath)

  # Ensure completion system is initialized
  if ! command -v compinit >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    autoload -Uz compinit
    compinit
  fi

  # Load completion if available
  if [[ -f ~/.config/wt/completions/_wt ]]; then
    autoload -Uz _wt
  fi
fi
```

#### **Zsh Completion File Structure:**
```bash
#compdef wt
# Zsh completion for wt (worktree-utils)

_wt() {
    local context state line
    typeset -A opt_args

    _arguments -C \
        '1: :_wt_commands' \
        '*:: :->args'
    # ... rest of completion logic
}

# NO CALLS TO compdef OR _wt at the end!
```

### Issues Fixed
- ✅ `--help` flag now works properly
- ✅ Removed zsh completion startup errors
- ✅ Setup command now detects and repairs broken installations
- ✅ File structure follows zsh conventions
- ✅ Tests updated to match new shell-specific behavior

### Critical Issue Discovered and Fixed
- ❌ **Empty binary file bug**: Setup was creating 0-byte `~/.local/bin/wt-bin` files
- ❌ **compinit re-initialization bug**: Init script logic failed to run `compinit` after fpath changes
  - **Root cause**: `if ! command -v compinit` check prevented re-initialization in existing shells
  - **Fix**: Always run `autoload -Uz compinit && compinit` after fpath modifications
  - **Impact**: Completion appeared to load but tab completion didn't work

### Verified Working Patterns
- ✅ Empty binary issue fixed by running setup again with working local binary
- ✅ Completion loading works with corrected init script pattern
- ✅ One-line test that always works: `echo 'fpath=(~/.config/wt/completions $fpath); autoload -Uz compinit && compinit; autoload -Uz _wt; type _wt' | zsh`

### Deep Research and Analysis Phase

After hours of debugging without sustainable progress, conducted comprehensive research into how successful CLI tools (kubectl, docker, git, gh) handle zsh completion:

**Key Research Findings**:
- ✅ Process substitution (`source <(tool completion zsh)`) is most reliable method
- ✅ Standard fpath directories eliminate need for fpath manipulation
- ✅ Multiple installation methods are essential for different user setups
- ✅ Framework integration (Oh-My-Zsh) is critical for many users
- ✅ Completion cache clearing should be built-in troubleshooting

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- ❌ Our custom directory approach requires complex fpath manipulation
- ❌ Single-method installation doesn't handle diverse user environments
- ❌ No framework integration causes conflicts with Oh-My-Zsh users
- ❌ Missing cache management leads to persistent issues
- ❌ Over-engineered solution when simpler patterns exist

**Documentation Created**:
- Updated `docs/ZSH_COMPLETION_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` with research findings and links
- Created `docs/COMPLETION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` with comprehensive fix strategy

**Implementation Strategy**: Implemented process substitution approach matching kubectl/helm pattern

### Final Working Implementation

**✅ COMPLETED: Process Substitution Solution**
- Enhanced `wt completion zsh` to output self-contained script with built-in compdef
- Updated setup command to add `source <(wt-bin completion zsh)` to shell configs
- Matches industry standard pattern used by kubectl, helm, terraform
- No files, no fpath manipulation, works with all zsh configurations

**✅ COMPLETED: Fresh Shell Testing Infrastructure**
- Created comprehensive Make testing commands (`make test-completion`, etc.)
- Built `./scripts/test-completion.sh` for automated verification
- Solved shell corruption issues during development/debugging
- Documented testing tools in CLAUDE.md

**✅ COMPLETED: Documentation Cleanup**
- Created focused `docs/ZSH_COMPLETION_GUIDE.md` with working solution
- Condensed `docs/ZSH_COMPLETION_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` to remove outdated approaches
- Removed complex implementation plan that's no longer needed
- Added fresh shell testing tools to prevent future debugging loops

**Key Learning**: Simple process substitution works better than complex file-based approaches. Testing must happen in fresh shells to avoid debugging artifacts.

### Commits Made
- `6197503` - fix: add --help flag support and improve zsh completion
- `bb4a031` - chore: remove legacy wt.sh shell script
- `6a9848e` - feat: fix zsh completion with proper file structure and loading
- `5c45151` - fix: improve setup completion validation and shell-specific file generation

### Next Steps for Future Sessions
1. **PRIORITY**: Test end-to-end completion in fresh shell
2. Debug why autoload sometimes doesn't work automatically
3. Fix binary copy issue in setup process
4. Create comprehensive completion testing documentation
5. Release v0.6.2 with all fixes

### Documentation Created
This session log with critical zsh completion patterns that work.

## 2025-06-14 - Shell Completion Implementation (Issue #5)

### Context
After completing comprehensive edge case testing in Issue #1 and releasing v0.5.1, implemented shell completion support for both bash and zsh to improve user experience.

### Work Completed
1. **Completion Architecture Design:**
   - Created `internal/completion` package with modular architecture
   - Designed completion data structure for commands, aliases, branches, and project commands
   - Implemented pattern for dynamic completion (branches via git commands)

2. **Core Completion Implementation:**
   - Created `internal/completion/completion.go` - Core completion logic and data structures
   - Created `internal/completion/bash.go` - Bash completion script generation
   - Created `internal/completion/zsh.go` - Zsh completion script generation with descriptions
   - Added command handler in `cmd/wt/main.go` for `wt completion <shell>` command

3. **Setup Integration:**
   - Enhanced `internal/setup/setup.go` with completion installation functions
   - Added `CompletionOptions` struct for controlling completion behavior
   - Modified setup command to accept `--completion <shell>` and `--no-completion` flags
   - Updated shell init script to automatically load completion files
   - Added completion file checking to setup verification

4. **Comprehensive Testing:**
   - Created `internal/completion/completion_test.go` - Unit tests for completion logic

   - Support for command flags and arguments completion

### Technical Details
- **Completion Files**: Generated as `~/.config/wt/completion.bash` and `~/.config/wt/completion.zsh`
- **Shell Integration**: Automatic loading via updated init script based on shell detection
- **Command Interface**: `wt completion bash` and `wt completion zsh` for manual generation
- **Setup Options**:
  - `wt setup --completion auto` (default)
  - `wt setup --completion bash|zsh`
  - `wt setup --no-completion`
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when git commands fail or no project context exists

### Key Decisions
- Used file-based completion over eval-based for better performance and caching
- Implemented both bash and zsh support for broader compatibility
- Made completion installation optional with auto-detection as default
- Integrated completion with existing setup command rather than separate installer
- Generated completion files during setup rather than dynamically at runtime

### Verification
- All completion tests passing: `make test-ci` ✅
- Manual testing of bash and zsh completion generation works correctly
- Setup command properly installs and configures completion files
- Check command verifies completion installation status

### Next Steps

## 2025-06-13 - Fix GitHub Actions Test Failures

### Context
GitHub Actions tests were failing due to branch name inconsistencies. Tests expected "main" but Git repositories were being created with "master" as the default branch.

### Work Completed
1. **Root Cause Analysis:**
   - Identified that test repositories were using "master" instead of "main"
   - Multiple test failures across worktree package and integration tests
   - Error: "fatal: invalid reference: main" when trying to add existing branch

2. **Test Repository Fix:**
   - Updated `test/helpers/git.go` to use `--initial-branch=main` for repository creation
   - Applied fix to both `CreateTestRepo()` and `CreateBareRepo()` functions
   - Ensures consistent branch naming across all test scenarios

3. **Verification:**
   - All tests now pass locally: `make test` ✅
   - Full CI pipeline passes: `make test-ci` ✅
   - Committed fix with proper conventional commit message

### Technical Details
- Changed `git init` to `git init --initial-branch=main`
- Changed `git init --bare` to `git init --bare --initial-branch=main`
- This ensures Git creates "main" instead of "master" regardless of system configuration

### Outcome
- GitHub Actions tests should now pass consistently
- All local tests passing (worktree, integration, and unit tests)
- Resolved the "add_existing_branch" test failure that expected "already" error message

### Next Steps
- Monitor GitHub Actions to confirm tests pass in CI environment
- Continue with any remaining development tasks

---

   - Configured hooks for:
     - Trailing whitespace removal
     - End-of-file fixing
     - YAML validation
     - Go formatting (gofmt)
     - Go vetting
     - Go mod tidy
     - Go build verification
     - Conventional commit messages
   - Worked around golangci-lint v1.55.2 compatibility issues with Go 1.24

2. **golangci-lint Configuration:**
   - Created `.golangci.yml` for future use
   - Configured linters: gofmt, govet, errcheck, gosimple, ineffassign, unused, misspell, goimports
   - Added exceptions for test files and update.go global variables
   - Added note about Go 1.24 compatibility issue

3. **Documentation Updates:**
   - Updated CONTRIBUTING.md with pre-commit setup instructions
   - Added Makefile targets: `setup-hooks` and `lint-all`

4. **Code Cleanup:**
   - Fixed trailing whitespace across entire codebase
   - Fixed missing newlines at end of files
   - All files now pass pre-commit checks

### Key Decisions
- Used pre-commit (Python-based) over lefthook (Go-based) for better ecosystem support
- Temporarily excluded golangci-lint from pre-commit due to Go 1.24 compatibility
- Enforced conventional commits with scope requirement
- Kept golangci-lint config for future use when compatibility improves

## 2025-06-13 - Locale Handling Fix

### Context
User asked about LANG=C prefix requirement for tests and requested a permanent fix to avoid manual locale setting.

### Work Completed
1. **Fixed locale handling in tests:**
   - Created `test/integration/common_test.go` with shared test helpers
   - Added LANG=C environment setting to all command executions in tests
   - Updated all exec.Command calls to include consistent locale:
     - `buildTestBinary()` - Sets LANG=C for go build
     - `runCommand()` - Sets LANG=C for wt command execution
     - Git commands in test helpers - Sets LANG=C for git operations
   - Removed duplicate function definitions across test files

2. **Verified fix works:**
   - All tests now pass without requiring manual LANG=C prefix
   - Tests work consistently across different locale settings
   - No changes required to production code

### Key Decisions
- Set LANG=C only in test execution, not globally
- Maintained locale consistency across all test helpers
- Created common test file to reduce duplication
- Kept production code unchanged - only test infrastructure modified

### Next Steps
- Continue with remaining test implementation tasks
- Add tests for setup and update packages

   - Complete workflow tests (`test/integration/workflow_test.go`)
   - Command alias tests (`test/integration/aliases_test.go`)
   - Tests CD: and EXEC: prefix handling

5. **Added CLI entry point tests:**
   - Created `cmd/wt/main_test.go`
   - Tests for usage output, version formatting
   - Tests for shell wrapper output
   - Command line argument parsing tests

6. **Implemented command aliases:**
   - Added `ls` as alias for `list`
   - Added `switch` and `s` as aliases for `go`
   - Updated help text to show aliases
   - Added tests to verify aliases work correctly

7. **Set up GitHub Actions CI:**
   - Created `.github/workflows/test.yml` for testing
   - Multi-OS testing (Ubuntu, macOS)
   - Coverage reporting with Codecov
   - Linting with golangci-lint
   - Added test badge to README

### Key Decisions
- Started with unit tests before integration tests as recommended in testing plan
- Used table-driven tests throughout for clarity and maintainability
- Created comprehensive test helpers to reduce duplication
- Handled platform-specific issues (macOS symlinks) in tests
- Implemented aliases as a map for easy extension
- Chose simple, git-like aliases (ls, switch) for familiarity

### Next Steps
- [ ] Fix failing integration tests (env-copy, project commands)
- [ ] Add tests for setup and update packages
- [ ] Implement shell completion support
- [ ] Add "help <command>" for detailed help
- [ ] Consider interactive mode for branch selection
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks

### Test Coverage Status
- ✅ `test/helpers` - Complete helper package
- ✅ `internal/worktree` - Core functionality tested
- ✅ `internal/config` - Configuration system tested
- ⬜ `internal/setup` - No tests yet
- ⬜ `internal/update` - No tests yet
- ✅ `cmd/wt` - Basic tests implemented
- ✅ Integration tests - Shell wrapper and workflows tested

## 2025-06-05 - Worktree Base Configuration Fix

### Context
User reported that `wt` doesn't respect the `worktree_base` setting in project configurations.

### Work Completed
1. **Investigated the issue:**
   - Found that `worktree_base` is stored in project config but never used
   - Commands `wt add` and `wt new` always use the default convention
   - `GetWorktreeBase()` in internal/worktree/worktree.go:30 ignores project settings

2. **Implemented fix:**
   - Modified `worktree.Add()` to accept `*config.Manager` parameter
   - Modified `worktree.NewWorktree()` to accept `*config.Manager` parameter
   - Both functions now check for project-specific `worktree_base` setting
   - Updated calls in main.go to pass the config manager

3. **Created documentation:**
   - Created `docs/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md` - Documents architectural patterns
   - Created `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` - Development workflow guide
   - Created `docs/CLI_ERGONOMICS.md` - CLI usability assessment
   - Created this `SESSION_LOG.md` for session continuity

### Key Decisions
- Chose explicit parameter passing (Option A) over other patterns for config access
- Maintained backward compatibility - if no `worktree_base` is set, uses default convention
- Documented the pattern for future consistency

### Next Steps
- [ ] Test the worktree_base fix with actual project configs
- [ ] Consider implementing some of the "quick win" ergonomic improvements from CLI_ERGONOMICS.md
- [ ] Add shell completion support
- [ ] Create tests for the configuration system

### Open Questions
- Should we add a `wt config` command to view/edit project settings?
- Should project detection also consider .git/config for more flexibility?
