# CLI Ergonomics Assessment

This document evaluates the usability and ergonomics of the `wt` command-line interface.

## Current State: Excellent Ergonomics ✅

**Status**: The CLI has achieved excellent ergonomics through "Do What I Mean" design principles.

### Ergonomic Excellence Achieved ✅

1. **Smart Commands** - `wt new` intelligently handles any branch state (new/existing/has worktree)
2. **Fuzzy Resolution** - `wt go mai` auto-matches to `main`, no exact names required
3. **Universal Help** - All commands support `--help`/`-h` with detailed documentation
4. **Direct Shortcuts** - `wt 0`, `wt 1`, `wt 2` provide instant navigation
5. **Intelligent Errors** - Failed commands show numbered suggestions instead of cryptic errors
6. **Multiple Aliases** - `ls` (list), `switch`/`s` (go) for different user preferences
7. **Interactive Fallbacks** - Ambiguous inputs trigger smart selection menus

### Core Commands (All Optimized)
- `wt list` / `wt ls` - List all worktrees with indices
- `wt new <branch>` - Smart creation (handles all branch states)
- `wt go <branch>` / `wt switch` / `wt s` - Smart navigation with fuzzy matching
- `wt 0`, `wt 1`, `wt 2` - Direct index shortcuts
- `wt rm <branch>` - Smart removal with fuzzy matching
- `wt env-copy <branch>` - Environment synchronization

### Previous Pain Points: All Resolved ✅

1. **Command Duplication** ✅ RESOLVED - `wt new` handles all cases, `wt add` is obsolete
2. **Exact Name Requirements** ✅ RESOLVED - Fuzzy matching works everywhere
3. **Missing Help** ✅ RESOLVED - Universal `--help`/`-h` support
4. **Naming Inconsistency** ✅ RESOLVED - Added `ls`, `switch`, `s` aliases
5. **Poor Error Messages** ✅ RESOLVED - Smart suggestions and error guidance
## Example Workflows

### Typical Development Flow
```bash
$ wt new feature-auth    # Smart creation (branch + worktree + switch)
# → "Created branch 'feature-auth' and switched to worktree"

# ... work on feature ...

$ wt go mai             # Fuzzy match back to main
# → "Switched to worktree 'main'"

$ wt rm feat            # Fuzzy match removal
# → "Removed worktree 'feature-auth'"
```

### Quick Navigation Examples
```bash
$ wt 0                  # Instant switch to first worktree
$ wt 1                  # Instant switch to second worktree
$ wt go bug             # Auto-matches to 'bugfix-123'
$ wt s dev              # Short alias, matches 'development'
```

### Error Handling Examples
```bash
$ wt go xyz
# → "branch 'xyz' not found. Did you mean:
#     1. main
#     2. fix-xyz-bug
#     3. feature-xyz"

$ wt go te
# → Shows interactive picker: [test-branch, test-feature, temp-fix]
```

## Remaining Enhancement Opportunities

The only remaining ergonomic improvement area is **environment management**:

**Current**: `wt env-copy feature --recursive`
**Future**: `wt env sync feature` (unified subcommand structure)

## Summary

**Mission Accomplished**: The CLI has achieved excellent ergonomics through intelligent design. Users can express intent (`wt go mai`, `wt new feature`) and the tool handles implementation details automatically. The "Do What I Mean" philosophy has been successfully implemented throughout the interface.
