## Description

The handleRecentCommand function is 211 lines long with high cognitive complexity (65). This makes it difficult to understand and maintain. Break it down into smaller, focused functions for better readability and testability.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Function broken into smaller logical units
- [x] Cognitive complexity reduced below 20
- [x] All existing functionality preserved
- [x] Tests still pass

## Implementation Plan

1. Extract flag parsing logic into parseRecentFlags function
2. Extract branch fetching and filtering into fetchAndFilterBranches function
3. Extract navigation logic into navigateToBranch function
4. Extract branch display logic into displayBranches function
5. Extract branch info collection into collectBranchInfo function
6. Keep main function as orchestrator
7. Run tests to ensure no regression
8. Verify cognitive complexity is reduced

## Implementation Notes

Successfully refactored handleRecentCommand to reduce cognitive complexity:
- Extracted 6 helper functions for different responsibilities
- Reduced main function from 211 lines to 45 lines
- Cognitive complexity reduced from 65 to well below 20
- All tests pass and functionality preserved
- Code is now much more readable and maintainable
