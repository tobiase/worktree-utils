## Description

The recent command performance should be tested with repositories containing hundreds or thousands of branches to ensure it scales well. This is important for users working on large monorepos or projects with many contributors.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Benchmark tests created for 100 500 1000+ branches
- [ ] Performance metrics documented
- [ ] Identify any bottlenecks
- [ ] Optimize if performance degrades significantly
- [ ] Consider adding progress indicator for slow operations
