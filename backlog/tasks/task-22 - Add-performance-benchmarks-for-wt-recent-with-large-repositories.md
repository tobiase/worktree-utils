## Description

The recent command performance should be tested with repositories containing hundreds or thousands of branches to ensure it scales well. This is important for users working on large monorepos or projects with many contributors.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Benchmark tests created for 100 500 1000+ branches
- [x] Performance metrics documented
- [x] Identify any bottlenecks
- [x] Optimize if performance degrades significantly
- [x] Consider adding progress indicator for slow operations

## Implementation Plan

1. Create benchmark test file cmd/wt/recent_bench_test.go
2. Implement helper functions to create test repositories with many branches
3. Add benchmarks for various branch counts (100, 500, 1000, 5000)
4. Test different flag combinations (default, --all, --others)
5. Document performance characteristics in the code
6. Run benchmarks and analyze results

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented comprehensive performance benchmarks for the `wt recent` command:

- Created `cmd/wt/recent_bench_test.go` with multiple benchmark functions
- Implemented benchmarks for branch counts from 100 to 10,000
- Added benchmarks for different flag combinations (default, --all, --others, -v)
- Created helper functions to generate test data and repositories
- Documented results in `cmd/wt/BENCHMARKS.md`

Key findings:
- Branch filtering performance scales linearly with branch count
- Even with 10,000 branches, filtering takes less than 0.2ms
- Display formatting adds approximately 1Âµs per branch
- No performance bottlenecks identified in the Go code
- Main bottleneck would be git operations, not our implementation

Decision: No optimization needed as performance is excellent. Progress indicator not required for the Go code itself, though might be useful if git operations are slow on very large repositories.

Modified files:
- cmd/wt/recent_bench_test.go: New comprehensive benchmark test file
- cmd/wt/BENCHMARKS.md: Performance documentation with results and analysis
